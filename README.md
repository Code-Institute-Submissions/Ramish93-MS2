## __Overview__:
I designed this website in two pages with same navigation, contact us section to show consistancy to user and so that they can move around and find text field for custum made glasses with contact us area easily.
As enormous increase in awareness now everybody wants to start an e-commerse website so they can work from home.
The goal of website is to have user look around to find what they like and if they dont are not satisfied with what they see they could also write us about their idea and see the loction of our store in stockhom and let us help them decide.
## __Description__:
* It is a inspiring e-commerse model website designed to give user control over design and material of the product they want and if they want to see the designs in person they can always come to the store given by google maps API on second page of website.

## UX
### __Strategy__
The idea behind this website is to attract indivisual of all ages to come and have full control over what they want to wear. there are alot of people who find themselves in predicaments where they like a product but only one part of the product doesn't fit their need so they
have to leave the product. for those people this e-commerse website will give them full control over the design and style of their own choosing.
#### Website Goals:
* The main goal of website is to promote shades in people of all ages and the strategy for it is to give them what they really want to wear.
* My target audiance is people from all ages but essencially youth because coming summer shades are not a need they are a necessity. To give them what they want not what other stores have to offer only.

#### User goals are:
* In world with covid its not ideal for people to go out in stores and purchase stuff so this e-commerse website is for everybody so they can get what they want from ease of their home and have full control over style of the product.
* Shades are a need for almost everybody and with this pandamic it is more of a necessity and this coming summer this Bussiness will give user a chance to decide and style their own shades to give them a feeling of exclusiveness.
* A small but intuative bussiness like this will give people a chance to control a product and design it however they like and they think will good on them. it not only increse the confidenace but give a feeling that this product is specificly made for them.
* Generally people want to feel good about themselves that they are contributing in making a product for themselves.

This website would be great in acheiving these goals mentioned above because:

* It would provide a platform for participants to put out their amazing ideas in the product which will in return allow the bussiness to grow by knowing what customer want and what is they feel most confortable in.
* Helping out 
* participants will be motivated to make dietary changes in their daily life-style and they would be given new inovative recepies that other participants have tried to make this coversion easy and smooth in order to mantain a healthy life style.
* Along with advantage of a clean neighborhood and self-confidenace this cleaning will provide as an exercise including walking and carring weight which would be part of a healthy life-style.
* As mentioned earlier that donating money while siting at home isn't sufficiant to provide confidence and heppiness that we are helping our community, On the other hand participating in such activities would help participants achive that feeling at it's full potential.

#### Developement and Bussiness goals:
* A website created to motivated people to help change world and themselves.
* A website created with HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap framework which is exciting and motivating to look at.
* I am as a developer happy and excited to make it a part of my work port-folio.
* In future seeing the popularity of this project i can think of turning it into an organiztion that targets people from all around the world making these changes in their lifes.

#### User Stories:
1. As a person looking to make a difference in myself and world i would want to see what is this site for which i would easily find and understand by hero image and clear information presented on front page.
2. I would like to have intuative navigation so i can surf the website easily so my website is easy to navigate with a nav-bar at top right and with clear discription of where it takes user.
3. As a new user i would like to have all the necessary information infront of me so i don't waste my time looking for what i don't need so the Website has all necessity information on front page.
4. When is see and like the webiste and it's purpose i would like to start so for that there would be a campaign for new year cleaning so the user starts with it and be part of a big team.
5. I would like to have options to sign-up either when i'm on first page reading information or on last page reading about meet-ups. To join the group there are two sign up buttons 1. on top of page on all screen sizes and one on the third page of website with the meet-ups information.
6. I would like to sign-up quick so to make the process easy the top-right button of sign up is a modal form bootstrap so there is a pop-up window that easily sign-up user.
7. The goal of website is to make user participate in the good work so With the intuative design and easy sign-up user would feel great after signing up and taking part in a campaign as New Years Resolution.
8. I would like to contact who made the Website and took the initiative for that there would be a contact us information in footer.

### **Scope**:
This website incorporates an MVP (Minimal VIable Product) method which I considered a good idea for the following reasons:
* It brings the basic layout of the website and grants awareness to user how the website is going to look like.
* It gives me an opportunity to see my design take a beautiful shape and improve it where necessary.
* Includes relevent and defining imagery and icons to make webpage look more exciting and fullfilling.
* Testimonials of participents to boost the confidence of first time user and to give them confidence to be a part of the change.
* Relevent FAQ's so that first time or a permenant user can find any answers they are looking for which is a part of intuative website.
* Social media icons so that user can see and follow our work immediately.
* Contact information and meet-ups so user feels confertable in talking and bringing any ideas forward that they would like to work on.
### **Structure**:
I designed this website in three pages with same navigation, connect with us and footer section to show consistancy to user and so that they can move around and find signup and contact information not matter which page they are on.
All pages have difference hero image that fits perfectly with the purpose of the page. and use of icon and images enhance user experience. All pages are have different theme and user will know the theme of specific page just by looing at the hero image. In addition to that they have a cover-text that inspires them to
take part in NEW YEAR CLEAN-UP as first activity to give them a boost and make them feel good about themselves to start the new year with a fullfilling experience.
### **Skeleton**:
The website is divided into three pages first with information about the problems of dirt and garbage around in our environment and how we propose to fix it. Second with dietary changes we need to do inorder to lead a strong healthy life. and third with information about our meetups and what we do in groups. i added some more content to second page as it was looking a littel small. The Wireframes are representation of project's final look.
### **Surface**:
I wanted to make first-time user see what this website is about without reading content and i achived it by using relevent imagery to each single page to let user feel the problem and need to do something about it. The use of colors was decided inorder with the color of earth's green forest which was to remind user that this is how our environment is supposed to look like.
#### Images:
* The images are selected very carefully with relevence to each page and indivisual section providing a feeling of confidenace and excitement to user.
#### Typography:
* I used Google Fonts to explore different fonts I could use with my website and decided on "Alegreya, Roboto" and "Serif" as the back-up font. Alegreya and Roboto were my choice because of its popular use and modern look and feel.
### **Features**:
 __Navbar:__ 
 * Navbar is created in dark green color (#188832) and nav-links with white to give a clear view to user. Navbar is not fixed to let user explore the full height of website and not getting diturbed by fixed stuck navbar.

 __Home Page:__ 
 * Home page has a hero image that gives a full idea to user what this website is about and with full name of website which is self-discriptive and our goal in jumbotron gives a full sence to user. I've added a cover-text on all pages to inspire user to initiate this great work by participating in new year clean-up when most of the areas around the city will be dirty because of new-years celebration.Then 
 i have feedback section from amazing participants. After that a section with FAQ's and relevent images and then connect with us with social media responsive icons and at last the footer with contact and meetup information.

 __Healthy diet page:__
 * In second page i use almost same layout to give consistancy to user and more make them clustered with entirely different dynamics of new page. i used three columns to create awareness about healthy diet and then images containers to show some amazing vegetarian receipes.
 __Meet-up page:__
 * In this last page i added handy link to a cafe where we meet and what we do in meet-ups. 
 * In Footer page i also added link to the care with timings so that its easy for user to navitage the website.
 ### __Features Left to Implement__:
 * I would love to add a validity to the signup form, but it was not in scope of this MS project.
 * I would love to expand the website world wide but with the limited time for MS1 project its only for stockholm now.
### Design Choices:
* __Font:__ The font family Roboto was chosen for this project because is has good readability and its very popular and 
 second font is Alegreya because it looks beautiful and appealing.
 * __Images:__ Images choser for the landing page shows a beautiful beach with some garbage in it to show that the beauty 
 of beach is affected by garbage and it our responsibility to clean it.
 * picture for Healhty diet page has asparagus in it which is a very healthy and loved vegtable. So it will be appealing to people 
 to convert to plant-based diet.
 * picture for meet-up page is a group of people enjoying coffee and having a conversation to show that is exactly how we intend to do 
 out meet-ups.
 * __Color:__ Color for the website is green which is the color of Mother-earth. To inspire user that this is how earth is supposed to be, Clean and green.
 * color used for links is green so that user can differentiate between text and links.
 * __Layout:__ The website in medium screen is not centered i made this design choice because centered view for medium screen is out-dated and boring. So i choose to have two columns side by side in each container and the third column under them in middle. Which , i think, gives it more aesthatic beauty.

### __Bugs and fixes:__
* My hero image was too bright and the text wasn't clear. i was using opacity on image and then is used linear-gradient technology as follow: 

  __background:linear-gradient(
      rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
      rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)
    ),
    url("images/cleanearth.jpeg") no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    overflow: hidden;__

and the image became dark as i wanted it to be.
* My Importance section and Feedback sections were merging into each other in mobile view but on desktop they were as i wanted them to be. I searched online on youtube, StackOverFlow and W3School i checked my Css file 
to fix the bug. The videos and StackOverFlow helped me figure out the problem which was that i gave Importance Container a fixed height which was causing the merging of content.
* My cover-text was mixing with the heading and text of jumbotron in some mobile views and ipad view i added media quries to fix it but its still not fixed in a few mobile views.
* In mobile view my Importance section was centered aligned with alot of padding on right side which was not something i liked so i add no-gutters class and changed the col-10 offset-1 in small screen view to col-12.
* On the meet-up page the hero image took some time to load which was because of the size of the image was too large and causing this delay. The filesize of the downloaded image was over 3900kb so I changed for another image.
* My form was not validating. upon clicking submit button nothing was happening despite of giving it required attribute. upon checking online on [code acadmey form submit](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/html-form-validation/exercises/required) it was my silly mistake of not adding type="submit" to my button.
---
### __Unfixed bugs__:
* On mobile devises the cover-text container is not showing its full text. it is convaying the information it is intended to but the full text if not visible. I tried to fix it in many ways but everytime i ended up disfiguring some other part of that section. I will however, keep on trying to figure it out.
* Social media icons are not responding at different screen widths as i want them to. They change size when viewed on xl-screen and on xs-screens but i would like them in medium size in medium screen size, which i was unable to figure out how to do. Pretty sure its my some silly mistake.
* Website is on its full width on all devices provided by chrome-dev-tools but it came to my attention in last hour that its showing some side left-out space in iphone 11 and above. Since they are not provided by dev-tools so i didn't know about it earlier. here are the screenshots of both Iphone 12Pro Max and Samsung Note10+. Note 10 is 
deploying website as intended but when we zoom out in Iphone 12ProMax it shows a side zoom. i added viewport size in head of my Html but it is not working. This shows the importance of checking website across different devices.
* On Samsung Note 10 Plus:

### __Testing__:
* Form and Modal are tested. If we press the submit button without putting any information in fields the response should be 'Please fill out this field'. it was checked acress different Android Mobiles and tablets and Apple Mobile and tablets.
* All the links in across all three pages take the user to desired location and they open in another tab. They also get highlighted and underlined when hovered and they also have different colors than regular text to make user see them with ease.
* The website is tested in __Android__: Samsung Note 3, Note 4, Galexy S8,S9 Moto 4G, Pixel 2 and 2XL, and __Apple__: Iphone 4,5,6,7,8 and X as well as Ipad and Ipad pro.
